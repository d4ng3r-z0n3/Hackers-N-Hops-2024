Everyone at the Haunted Brewery received a weird text message that deleted itself shortly after being sent. We have reason to believe we're currently being attacked by an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). The only thing we managed to recover from the texts was the word "UNC788".

What is the name of the malware that was most likely delivered to our phones? Flag format: HnH{flag}
```

Flag: `HnH{HilalRAT}`
